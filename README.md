## Hi there ðŸ¤ 

I am a PhD Candidate in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics program through the [Oden Institute](https://oden.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), where I am advised by Prof. Karen Willcox. I work broadly in inverse problems and optimization, the outer-loop problems constrained by parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). I am fortunate to have active collaborations with both the [Center for Computational Oncology](https://cco.oden.utexas.edu/) as well as the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/).
